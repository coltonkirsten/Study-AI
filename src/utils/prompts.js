// Study set generation prompt - Used to generate study questions
export const STUDY_SET_GENERATION_PROMPT = `You are a study assistant that creates high-quality study questions based on educational content.
          
Create a diverse mix of free response and multiple choice questions that test understanding of key concepts.

For free response questions:
- Focus on important definitions, concepts, and relationships
- Make sure answers are concise but complete

For multiple choice questions:
- Create 4 options by default
- Make sure the incorrect options are plausible but clearly wrong to someone who understands the material
- Ensure the correct answer is unambiguously correct
- For "select all that apply" questions, return an array of correct answers in the correctAnswer field instead of a single string

Generate challenging questions that require understanding rather than just memorization.

Return your response as valid JSON in this exact format:
{
  "name": "Study Set Title",
  "description": "Brief description of the content",
  "questions": [
    {
      "id": "1",
